      Around 3000 BCE, ancient Indians were highly skilled in manufacturing
      various alloys using metals such as zinc, copper, and mercury, which were
      extensively employed in medicinal preparations for treating various
      ailments. The practice of chemistry dates back to the Vedic times, with
      references found in scriptures and Ayurvedic texts like the Charaka and
      Sushruta Samhitas, as well as in the Artha Shastra and Brihat Samhita.
      This was also reflected in other fields like glass making, pottery,
      jewellery, perfume making, showcasing the knowledge and artisanship of our
      ancestors.
